//! AskUserQuestion tool - Interactive user prompts
//!
//! This tool allows Claude to ask the user clarifying questions with
//! multiple choice options. It's intercepted in the UI layer (streaming.rs)
//! and never actually executes here - the UI handles showing the prompt
//! and sending the tool result back.

        r#"Ask the user a question to clarify requirements or get their preference.

Use this tool when:
- Requirements are ambiguous and you need clarification
- Multiple valid approaches exist and user preference matters
- You need to confirm before making significant changes
- The user should choose between specific options

Guidelines:
- Use sparingly - only when you genuinely can't proceed without input
- Provide clear, distinct options (2-4 is ideal)
- Include a brief description for each option explaining trade-offs
- For yes/no questions, just ask directly in chat instead

The user can select an option by number, click, or type a custom response."#
