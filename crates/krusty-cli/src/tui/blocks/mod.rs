//! Stream blocks - modular widgets for chat stream rendering
//!
//! Each block type implements the StreamBlock trait and handles its own
//! rendering, interaction, and state management.
//!
//! Blocks support partial visibility via ClipContext - when scrolled partially
//! off-screen, they receive clip info to render borders correctly.
