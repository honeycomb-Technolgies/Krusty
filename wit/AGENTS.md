# AGENTS Guide: /wit

## Purpose
Top-level WIT contracts shared by extension tooling.

## Guardrails
- WIT updates are compatibility-sensitive.
- Version contract changes intentionally; avoid silent breaking renames.
- Keep generated/runtime expectations synchronized across crates.

## Validation
- run extension-related checks after WIT changes.
